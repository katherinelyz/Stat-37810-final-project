##1 Algorithm and implementation

```{r}
betametropolis <- function(startvalue, c, iterations=10000){
  chain = rep(0, iterations)
  for (i in 1:iterations){
    currentvalue <- rbeta(1, c * startvalue, c * (1 - startvalue))
    proposal <- dbeta(startvalue, c * currentvalue, c * (1 - currentvalue)) / dbeta(currentvalue, c * startvalue, c * (1 - startvalue))
    posterior <- dbeta(currentvalue, 6, 4) / dbeta(startvalue, 6, 4)
    if (runif(1) < min(1, posterior * proposal)){
      startvalue <- currentvalue
      chain[i] <- startvalue
    }else{
      chain[i] <- startvalue
    }
  }
  return(chain)
}

# generate a starting value from a uniform distribution
startvalue <- runif(1)
# set c=1 and run for 10,000 total iterations
draws <- betametropolis(startvalue, 1, 10000)
```

##2 Evaluate the performance of the sampler

### Trace plot, autocorrelation plot, and histogram of the draws

```{r}
# plots for c=1
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
plot(draws, type = "l", main = "Trace plot"); acf(draws, main = "Autocorrelation plot"); hist(draws, main = "Histogram")
```

### Compare the draws with the target distribution Beta(6,4)

```{r}
#histogram of the draws with Beta(6,4)
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
hist(draws, freq = FALSE)
x<-seq(0, 1, 0.01)
lines(x, dbeta(x, 6, 4))
```

We can see that graphically, the target distribution Beta(6,4) is not a very good fit for the histogram of the draws. 

```{r}
#ks test
ks.test(jitter(draws, 0.0001), rbeta(10000, 6, 4))
```

Most of the time, the p-value of the Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test is less than 0.05. So, it's very likely that we will reject the null hypothesis that the draws and the target distribution Beta(6,4) are the same.

##3 Re-run this sampler with c = 0.1, c = 2.5 and c = 10

### Trace plot, autocorrelation plot, and histograms with c = 0.1, c = 2.5 and c = 10

```{r}
#plots for c = 0.1, 2.5, 10
cvec<-c(0.1, 2.5, 10)
for (i in 1:length(cvec)){
  par(mfrow=c(1, 3))
  draws=betametropolis(startvalue, cvec[i], 10000)
  plot(draws, type = "l", main = paste("Trace plot: c = ", cvec[i])); acf(draws, main = paste("Autocorrelation plot: c = ", cvec[i])); hist(draws, freq = FALSE, main = paste ("Histogram: c = ", cvec[i]))
  x<-seq(0, 1, 0.01)
  lines(x, dbeta(x, 6, 4))
}
```


From the autocorrelation plots, we can see that c = 1 has most lags, which requires thinning. c = 2.5 has least lags, which is most effective at drawing from the target distribution.

From the histograms, we can see that c = 10 seems to have the best fit for the target distribution Beta(6,4).

### The number of draws needed from the sampler before thinning and burn-in, and the comparison to the properties of the target distribution.
